1) What does construction “try … catch” do?
The try ... catch construction in Java is used for exception handling. It allows you to write a block of code to try that might generate an error or exception during its execution. The catch block is used to handle the exception that might be thrown in the try block. You can have multiple catch blocks to handle different types of exceptions specifically. This construction helps in managing runtime errors, allowing the program to continue running or fail gracefully by providing a user-friendly message or performing some cleanup operations rather than abruptly terminating.

2) What does it mean when the program throws exceptions?
When a program throws an exception, it means that an error condition has occurred during the execution of the program, and it cannot continue the normal flow of execution in its current context. Exceptions in Java are objects that describe an error condition, including what happened and where in the code it happened. Throwing an exception is Java's way of signaling that something went wrong, allowing you to handle the error condition explicitly through try ... catch blocks or to propagate the error up the call stack.

3) What is a Thread in Java?
A Thread in Java is a lightweight process that allows a program to operate more efficiently by performing multiple tasks at once. Each thread in Java is a separate path of execution within a program, allowing you to run code in parallel with the main execution thread. Java provides built-in support for multi-threading, enabling you to create, start, and manage threads using the Thread class and the Runnable interface. Threads are used in Java for operations that require background processing, simultaneous tasks, or any operation that can be divided into multiple, concurrently executing parts.
